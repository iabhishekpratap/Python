(a)  Primary Key:  Primary key is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a                                      record in database table. It cannot accept null, duplicate values. Only one Candidate                                      Key can be Primary Key.                         Alternate key: Alternate key is a key that can work as a primary key. Basically, it is a candidate key                                      that currently is not primary key.

(d)  Data integrity refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its                       entire lifecycle.                     (e)  DROP  command  is used  to drop a table with all records stored  in a table  whereas delete                       command is used to delete all records or some of the records from a table without deleting a table.                     (f)  MongoDB is built on architecture of collections and documents. Documents comprise sets of                       key-value pairs and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.                     (g)  Constraints are the rules enforced on data or columns on table. These are used to restrict the                       values that can be inserted in a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the                       database.                           •  DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.                          •  UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.

(a)  The difference between a compiler and an interpreter is described as follows:                        Interpreter: Translates a program written in a high-level language into the machine language by                                  converting and executing it line by line. The Interpreter is very useful for error-debugging                                  as it displays errors while translating a program into the machine language. It cannot                                  execute a program until all the errors are resolved.                        Compiler:  Works the same way as the interpreter. However, the main difference between the                                  interpreter and the compiler is that the compiler converts the entire program into the                                  machine language in one go and also reports all the errors in the program along with                                  the line numbers. When all the errors are rectified, the program is recompiled and after                                  that compiler is no longer needed in the memory.

ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other                       devices that work with text. Most modern character encodings which support many more characters                       than did the original have a historical basis in ASCII. Work on ASCII began in 1960. The first edition of                       the standard was published in 1963, a major revision in 1967, and in 1986. It currently defines codes                       for 128 characters where 33 are non-printing, and 94 are printable characters (excluding the space).

An internet protocol is a set of rules that governs internet activity and facilitates to complete                         a variety of actions on the World Wide Web.                          An IP address consists of four numbers, each of which contains one to three digits, separated by                         single dot (.). Each of the four numbers can range from 0 to 255.                          Examples of an IP address- 78.125.0.209. Every machine that is on the internet has a unique                         IP number.

(a)  Constraints are the rules enforced on data or columns on table. These are used to restrict the                         values that can be inserted in a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the                         database.                          Following are most commonly used constraints available in SQL:                            •  NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.                            •  CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain                             conditions.

NoSQL                       means not SQL or unlike SQL. NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a                       predefined schema.                    (d)  A relation is like a table in which data are arranged in the form of rows and columns.                                    The rows of a table are called tuples.                                    The columns of a table are called attributes.                     (e)  Data integrity refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its                       entire life cycle.                     (f)  A foreign key is a key which is used to link two tables together. This is also called a referencing key.                       Foreign Key is a column or a combination of columns whose values match a Primary Key in a different                       table. The relationship between two tables matches the Primary Key in one of the tables with a                       Foreign Key in the second table. If a table has a primary key defined on any field(s), then you cannot                       have two records having the same value of that field(s).

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language.                         2.  These commands allow us to perform tasks   2.  These commands are used to manipulate                           related to data definition, i.e., related to the   data, i.e.,  records  or  rows  in  a  table  or                           structure of the database objects (relations/  relation.                           databases).                         3.

How can you start Python through windows command prompt?                Ans.  If you set the Python path for windows, then you can start Python with the following:                     C :> python                 3.  What is IDLE?                Ans.  IDLE (Interactive Development and Learning Environment) is an environment for developing Python                    programs (“scripts”) under windows and other operating systems.                 4.  What are the two modes of working in Python?                Ans.  Python provides two modes of working:                     (a)  Interactive mode                     (b)  Script mode                  5.  What is a variable?                Ans.  A variable is an identifier/placeholder that holds a value. In other words, a variable is a reference to a                    computer memory location where the value is stored.                 6.  What can a variable hold in Python?                Ans.  In Python language, a variable can hold a string, a number or several other objects such as a function or                    a class. Variables can be assigned different values during execution.                 7.  Name the three key attributes of an object in Python.                Ans.  Each object in Python has three key attributes: a type, a value, and an id.                 8.  Define a keyword.                Ans.  A keyword is a reserved word in the Python programming language. Keywords are used to perform a                    specific task in a computer program.                 9.  Why is the given statement invalid in Python?                             x + 1 = x                Ans.  The statement is invalid because an expression cannot be placed on the left of the equal ‘=’ sign. Therefore,                    the correct statement should be:                             x = x + 1                 10.  What is the following statement termed as?                             a, b, c, d = 1, 2, 3, 4                Ans.  Multiple Assignment Statement.                 11.

Differentiate between single quotes, double quotes and triple quotes.                Ans.  The differences are:                      •  If you use single quotes, you do not have to escape double quotes and vice versa.                      •  If you use triple quotes, your string can span multiple lines.                 13.  Is string a sequence data type?                Ans.  Yes.                 14.  Define input() method.                Ans.  The purpose of an input() method is to fetch some information from the user of a program and store it                    into a variable.                                                                   1","15.  What is the role of a print() function?                 Ans.  A print() method prints an expression which may be a variable’s value or string or a blank line.                  16.  What does a print statement add to the end of the string?                 Ans.  By default, the print() function adds a new line to the end of the string being printed.                  17.  If you don’t use the sep option with print() function, what will it print?                 Ans.  If sep is not defined, a space is printed between the values received by the print statement.                  18.  What is the default value printed by giving end argument to print() method?                 Ans.  A new line (‘\\n’).                  19.  What is an operator in Python?                 Ans.  An operator works on data items and performs some mathematical operations or changes the data.                     For example, +, -, *, /, %, >, <, >=, <=, <<, >>, \&, |, ^, ==, etc.                  20.  When does a logical and operator produce true result?                 Ans.  The logical and operator evaluates to True only if both conditions/operands are true.                  21.  What is an expression? What does it constitute?                 Ans.  An operand or a combination of operands and operators, when evaluated, yields a single value called                     an expression. The expression consists of variables, constants, and functions.                  22.  What is modulo operator? Give an example.                 Ans.  The % operator is termed as modulo operator. It calculates the remainder of division of one number by                     another. For example, 5%2 shall return the result as 1, remainder obtained when we are dividing 5 by 2.                  23.  Which operator is used to compare the values of operands?                 Ans.  Relational operator.                  24.  How can we change the order of evaluation of operator?                 Ans.  We can use parentheses to alter the order of evaluation of an equation.                  25.  What is a unary operator? Give examples.                 Ans.  The operator which requires only one operand to operate upon is called unary operator. The + and –                     operators in Python can be used in both binary and unary forms.                  26.  Differentiate between binary and ternary operator.                 Ans.  The operators which require only two operands to work upon are binary operators and those which                     require three operands are ternary operators.                  27.  Differentiate between division operator (/) and floor division operator (//).                 Ans.  In Python, the division operator (/) performs integer division on two operands. We get exact division                     output. For example,                      >>> 5/2                     2.5                       The floor division (//) performs an integer division and, as a result, an integer is obtained.                     For example,                     >>> 8//3                     2                     >>>                       the fraction part gets truncated.                  28.  Which function can be used to know the data type of a variable?                 Ans.  type() method in Python allows you to know the data type of a variable.                  29.  Name the sequence surrounded by either single quotes or double quotes.                 Ans.  String                  30.  How can we convert a string to a number in Python?                 Ans.  A string which contains number will be converted to numeric type using int() function.                                                                  2","31.  Define a sequence construct.                Ans.  A sequence construct constitutes all the statements which are executed sequentially.                 32.  What is selection construct?                Ans.  A selection construct involves execution on the basis of certain test conditions.                 33.  What is a flow chart?                Ans.  A flow chart is a pictorial/graphical representation of a task. Flow charts are drawn using certain special-                    purpose symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals, and circles. These symbols are connected using                    arrows termed as flow lines.                  34.  Give an advantage of using a flow chart.                Ans.  Flow chart provides a unique feature of breaking down of a complex problem into parts in order to obtain                    the solution to a given problem.                 35.  Define an infinite loop.                Ans.  An infinite loop is a loop where a condition never becomes false and keeps on executing. It is a never-                    ending loop, such as a while loop in case the situation never resolves to a false value.                  36.  What is iteration construct?                Ans.  Iteration means repetition of a set of statements until the test condition remains true depending upon                    the loop.                 37.  Define the body of the loop.                Ans.  The sets of statements which get executed on the test condition becoming true is defined as the body of                    the loop.                 38.  What is an exit control loop? Give an example.                Ans.  An exit control loop is a loop which checks for condition to be true or false at the time of exit from the                    loop. For example, do...while.                 39.  What is the purpose of using a for loop?                Ans.  The for loop is used for definite/fixed number of iterations.                 40.  What are the supported data types in Python?                Ans.  Python has five standard data types—                     (i)  Numbers                     (ii)  String                     (iii)  List                     (iv)  Tuple                     (v)  Dictionary                 41.  Is Python object-oriented?                Ans.  Yes, Python is an Object-oriented Programming language.                 42.  What is the purpose of break statement?                Ans.  The break statement is used to forcefully terminate the loop execution where it has been given.                 43.  What is an exception in Python?                Ans.  An error that happens during the execution of the code/program is termed as an exception. For example,                    Syntax errors, runtime errors, like division by zero, are examples of exceptions in Python.                 44.  Which statement/construct is used to handle an exception in Python?                Ans.  try...except statement is used in Python to handle exceptions.                 45.  How many else clauses can be added in a try...except block?                Ans.  Only one.                 46.  How many except clauses can be included in a try block?                Ans.  Any number of except clauses can be included.                 47.  What is an empty string?                Ans.  An empty string contains no characters and has length as 0.                                                                 3","48.  Name the method that works reverse of split() method in strings.                 Ans.  join() method                  49.  Define a string.                 Ans.  A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable in Python, i.e., they cannot be modified once                     created.                  50.  Define a list in Python. Why is it mutable and dynamic in nature?                 Ans.  A list in Python is an ordered collection of items which may belong to any data type. A list is dynamic,                     immutable type as you can add or delete elements from the list any time.                   51.  What happens when an element gets deleted from a list?                 Ans.  When we remove an element from a list, the size or length of the list decreases by 1 position.                   52.  What does append() function do?                 Ans.  It simply adds/appends an element to the end of the list.                  53.  What is a dictionary?                 Ans.  A Python dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. The elements in a dictionary are indexed by keys                     which must be unique.                  54.  What does the item() method of dictionary return?                 Ans.  The item() method returns a list of dictionaries (key:value) pairs as tuples.                  55.  Why are Python dictionaries also termed as mappings?                 Ans.  Python dictionaries are called mappings because these are like a collection that allows us to look up for                     information associated with arbitrary keys.                  56.  Define a tuple.                 Ans.  A tuple is an immutable list which cannot be changed. Tuples are represented by elements enclosed                     with parentheses instead of square brackets.                  57.  Define MongoDB.                 Ans.  MongoDB is an object-oriented, simple, dynamic, and scalable, open source document database,                     document-oriented, NoSQL database.                  58.  What is NoSQL?                 Ans.  The database which supports document-based structure is called NoSQL database. In other words,                     NoSQL = Non SQL or Not only SQL.                  59.  Does MongoDB support SQL?                 Ans.  No.                  60.  Differentiate between list and tuples.                 Ans.  The differences between the two are:                       (i)  Lists are mutable while tuples are not.                       (ii)  Tuples can be used as keys for dictionaries while list can’t be used.                       (iii)  Tuples are used when the order of the elements in the sequence matters while the elements in list                          can be arranged in any order.                                                                                    4",""];
